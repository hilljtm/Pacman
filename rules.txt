Pacman 

Game Rules  

1. Pac-Man, our hero, moves around the room, munches all of the Dots he meets.  
2. Four ghosts roam the room, trying to catch Pac-Man. If a ghost chomps Pac-Man, a life is lost. When all lives have been lost, the game ends.  
3. In each corner of the room there is a "Power Pellet" that provides Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. Pac-Man can get extra points by eating the ghosts. The first one is worth 200 points and each additional ghost eaten is worth double the number of points (from 200 to 1600 per ghost eaten).  
4. Pac-Man can get extra points as "bonus fruit" appear. The number of points given for each fruit depending on the fruit type.  
5. When the Pac-Man reaches 10000 points, he gets an additional life.  
 
Scoring System

Vulnerable ghost succession doesnâ€™t have to be a continuous sequence, it means that it could be spaced out by other entities. 

Like this:  "VulnerableGhost,Dot,Dot,Dot,....,VulnerableGhost"  

The first VulnerableGhost is worth 200 points and the second one 400 points although there are some Dots between the first and the second occurrence.
